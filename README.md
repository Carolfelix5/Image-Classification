# Image Processing and Classification

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on image processing and classification. It includes Jupyter Notebook(s) with step-by-step code and explanations, demonstrating techniques to preprocess images and classify them using machine learning  models.

## Features
- Image preprocessing (e.g., resizing)
- Feature extraction techniques
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Performance evaluation metrics for classification tasks


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries like Numpy,Matplotlib,OpenCv

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
 - jupyter notebook
2. Run the notebook Image Processing and Classification.ipynb for a detailed walkthrough of the project.

### Dataset
